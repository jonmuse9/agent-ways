name: supply-audit
description: Run a read-only, tiered trust audit of an unfamiliar or untrusted repository — repo smell, secrets in git history, dangerous source patterns, and dependency vulnerabilities — ending in a go/no-go verdict. Use when vetting a repo before running or installing it, auditing a dependency or fork, or asked "is this repo safe", "audit this repo", "is this package trustworthy". Not for rewriting git history, setting up CI scanning, or fixing findings — it reads and reports only.

# Supply-Chain Trust Audit

A read-only, tiered audit of a repository you don't yet trust — a dependency, a
fork, a package, a clone you're about to run. It surfaces the evidence; **you and
the operator decide.** It never modifies the repo: no fixes, no history rewriting,
no CI setup. This is the deep, on-demand companion to the `supplychain` way's
inline pre-install check.

Run from the repo root (or pass a path). Work top-down; stop early and surface if
a tier turns up something disqualifying.

## Tier 1 — Repo smell

Cheap structural signals that something is hidden:

```bash
du -sh .git && du -sh . --exclude=.git    # .git >> tree → blobs buried in history
git rev-list --objects --all \
  | git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectsize) %(rest)' \
  | awk '/^blob/ && $2 > 1048576 {print $2, $3}' | sort -rn | head   # large blobs
git ls-files -i --exclude-standard         # committed-then-gitignored (classic leak)
```

## Tier 2 — Secrets in history

History keeps credentials even after they're deleted from the tree:

```bash
git log -p --all | grep -E '(AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}|sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}|ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}|glpat-[a-zA-Z0-9-]{20}|xox[bpas]-|-----BEGIN.*(PRIVATE|RSA))' | head -30
```

Found one? **Mask the value** in your report; if it's someone else's repo, note
responsible disclosure.

## Tier 3 — Dangerous source patterns

Language-agnostic red flags, weighted by *where* they appear (install/import-time
is worst):

| Pattern | Risk | Grep |
|---|---|---|
| `eval` / `exec` | arbitrary execution | `grep -rn 'eval\|exec'` |
| `base64` / `atob` decode | obfuscated payload | `grep -rn 'b64decode\|atob\|base64'` |
| `pickle` / `marshal` / `yaml.load` | deserialization RCE | `grep -rn 'pickle\|marshal\|yaml.load'` |
| `shell=True` / `os.system` | shell injection | `grep -rn 'shell=True\|os\.system\|os\.popen'` |
| network in setup / postinstall | exfiltration | `grep -rn 'requests\.\|urllib\|fetch(' setup.py __init__.py package.json` |

Context matters: `eval` in a template engine is normal; `eval` in `setup.py`, an
npm `postinstall`, or code that *decodes-then-executes* is the smell. Flag
install-time and import-time execution especially.

## Tier 4 — Dependency vulnerabilities

Scan the **lockfile** *before* installing — the install step itself runs code.
Detect the ecosystem and use the right tool; if it's missing, say so and suggest
the install rather than installing it yourself:

| Ecosystem | Tool |
|---|---|
| Any / multi | `osv-scanner --lockfile=<file>` |
| Python | `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` |
| Node | `npm audit` (or `osv-scanner --lockfile=package-lock.json`) |
| Rust | `cargo audit` |
| Go | `govulncheck ./...` |

Triage each hit: is the vulnerable path actually reached? dev vs. runtime dep?
patched version available? severity?

## Report

End with a structured verdict:

- **Findings by tier** — each with severity and the evidence (the command and what
  it showed).
- **Trust verdict** — one of: *clear* (no blocking findings), *caution* (things to
  understand before running), *do-not-run* (disqualifying: live secrets,
  install-time execution, critical unpatched vuln).
- **What you did NOT check** — name any tier skipped (tool missing, scan declined)
  so gaps read as gaps, never as a clean bill.

## Not for

- Rewriting git history to strip secrets or severing forks — that's the
  destructive `historysever` way, a separate deliberate act.
- Standing up CI scanning (Actions, Dependabot, CodeQL) — that's the `automation`
  way (setup, not audit).
- Fixing findings or upgrading dependencies — this reads and reports; remediation
  is a separate decision.
