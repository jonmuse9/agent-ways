description: Help the operator and Claude jointly compose a well-structured `/goal` condition before it's set — clarifying the end-state, the evidence, and the bounds. Use when the user wants to set a goal, frame a goal, "give Claude a goal", run Claude in goal mode, or asks for help writing a goal condition. Not for clearing a goal (`/goal clear`), not for running multi-stage delivery, and it does not invoke `/goal` itself — it hands you a condition to set.

# Goal Author

`/goal` is a Claude Code built-in: it sets a completion condition and keeps Claude
working turn-over-turn until a separate evaluator judges the condition met. The
mechanics live in the canonical reference — read it for the "how":

This skill is the judgment that doc can't make for you: **how to author a
condition worth handing to that loop.** A vague goal sends an autonomous loop in a
vague direction. A well-bounded one is the single highest-leverage moment the
operator gets — once it's set, per-turn approvals are gone — so it's worth
authoring deliberately, and authoring it *together*.

## Why together

The operator holds the intent and the bounds that matter; Claude holds the read of
the actual work. Neither alone writes a good condition. The shape is **assess →
align → draft**, with Claude doing the work of understanding *first* so the
operator's choices are informed, not cold. The point isn't to extract a spec from
the human — it's to converge on a shared one.

## Procedure

### 1. Assess (shallow)

Read just enough to make the conversation concrete: the current state, what "done"
would plausibly look like, and which irreversible actions this work *could* reach
(push/merge, publish, deploy, destructive deletes). Don't deep-plan — the only job
of this step is to earn an informed interview. A few `git` / `Read` / `Grep`
calls, not a survey.

### 2. Align (interview)

Propose a draft condition, then reach agreement with the operator on:

- **The end-state** — one measurable thing, not a vibe.
- **The evidence** — what *shown output* proves it (the evaluator judges what
  Claude surfaces in the conversation, not the world — see Key rules).
- **The bounds** — a turn or time cap, and the scope (which files/areas are in play).
- **The doors** — for each irreversible action the work could reach, rule it *in*
  or *out*. Default: out. The goal stops before it and surfaces.

Use `AskUserQuestion` with curated options and a recommendation. The menu is itself
how Claude demonstrates it understood the work — a signpost, not a quiz.

### 3. Draft (the condition)

Emit a single paste-ready condition string. The operator sets it. **This skill
does not run `/goal`** — composing and setting are deliberately separate steps so
the human reads the condition before entering the regime.

## What a good condition contains

- **One measurable end-state**, phrased so it's met by *shown evidence* — an exit
  code, a clean `git status`, a passing check — not by assertion.
- **A turn/time bound** — `…or stop after N turns` — so a stuck loop ends.
- **Scope constraints** that matter — `…without modifying files outside src/auth`.
- **A door clause** for any irreversible action ruled out, phrased so the evaluator
  can recognize the halt-state from the conversation — e.g. `…stop before any push
  or merge and surface for approval`.

Example:

```
the auth/ unit tests pass (npm test output shown, exit 0) and lint is clean,
without touching files outside src/auth, or stop after 15 turns;
stop before any push or merge and surface for my approval.
```

## Key rules

- **The evaluator reads surfaced text, not the world.** It can't run commands or
  read files itself, so the condition must be satisfiable by what Claude *shows*.
  This is why evidence beats assertion: "tests pass" clears on the claim; "npm test
  exits 0, output shown" clears on the proof — and that's the antidote to a loop
  optimizing for convincing prose over real results.
- **There is no model-side abort.** Once set, Claude cannot clear its own goal —
  only the operator (`/goal clear`), the met condition, an evaluator timeout, or
  session end can. A door clause is the only Claude-adjacent early exit, and it's
  soft (the evaluator judges it from surfaced text). Claude can always *decline* a
  destructive action and surface — the loop blocks stopping, it never forces an
  action — but it can't end the loop itself. Author the bounds accordingly.
- **Setting a goal is a regime change.** It removes per-turn approvals; the `◎`
  indicator shows it's active. Make sure the operator knows they're entering it —
  that legibility is what makes the hand-off fair.
- **One goal per session.** Setting a new one replaces the active goal.

## Not for

- Clearing or inspecting a goal — that's `/goal clear` and bare `/goal`.
- Running the work — this only authors the condition.
- Multi-stage delivery orchestration — that's a workflow, not a goal.
