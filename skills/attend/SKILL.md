# Attend — Active Awareness

<!--
Messaging guidance lives in three synchronized sources. When you edit
the peer-messaging section, the autonomy paragraph, the silence-is-valid
callout, or the CLI-is-the-contract note, update all three:

  - skills/attend/SKILL.md                                   (this file — read at /attend invocation)
  - tools/sensor-disclosure/src/disclosures/messaging.md     (runtime reheat fired by sensor-disclosure)
  - hooks/ways/softwaredev/environment/attend/attend.md      (just-in-time way via commands: attend)

Drift between the three causes agents to receive inconsistent guidance
at different points in a session. Keep the load-bearing framing
(send vs reply, autonomy, silence, CLI contract) in lockstep.
-->

Attend gives the session the awareness an employee would otherwise have ambiently — what is changing, who else is working, what deserves attention. It surfaces those changes as Monitor notifications, rate-limited so the channel stays calm: most of the time it is silent, and a notification means something actually moved. The peer-messaging commands below are workspace awareness for agent sessions — colleagues noticing and addressing each other, not a protocol to be ceremonious about.

## Step 1: Pre-flight

Check that `attend` is installed:

```bash
command -v attend
```

If not found, tell the user to run `make attend` or `make install` from the agent-ways repo. Stop here.

## Step 2: Launch via Monitor

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Monitor tool, NOT Bash.** Running attend via Bash blocks the tool call and discards notifications. Monitor is the only correct way to launch the sensor loop.

Call the Monitor tool with exactly these parameters:

- **command**: `attend run`
- **description**: `attend: git, peers, processes`
- **persistent**: `true`
- **timeout_ms**: `3600000`

Do NOT run `attend run` with the Bash tool. Do NOT use `run_in_background`. Only Monitor delivers stdout lines as async notifications into the conversation.

On startup, attend emits a usage summary notification. After that, notifications arrive only on meaningful state changes.

## Sensors

- **processes** — application presence (not PID churn)
- **git** — dirty files, branch changes, upstream divergence
- **peers** — other Claude Code sessions + signal files from peers

## CLI Reference

All commands below are one-shot — run with Bash, not Monitor.

### Peer messaging

Two commands cover every peer interaction:

```bash
attend send "starting a new topic"                 # new message
attend reply "responding to the last peer message" # reply (auto-threaded)
```

**Pick by intent:**

- **Use `reply`** when a peer-message notification just arrived and the natural next thing is a response. It auto-threads to that peer's message — no id, no lookup, no flag. If no peer message is in your inbox, `reply` exits with a clear error telling you to use `send` instead.
- **Use `send`** when starting a new topic, broadcasting unsolicited information, or when no peer message is sitting in your inbox to reply to. Defaults to broadcast (reaches every peer and every Aaron session). Use `--focus <name>` or `--to <path>` to narrow the scope.

**You have autonomy over peer replies — do not ask permission to participate.** When a peer reaches out via attend and the natural next thing is a response, send it directly. Do *not* stop to ask the operator "should I reply?" before answering. Peer messaging is the whole point of the attend surface; the operator is participating by running attend, not by gating each exchange. They can intervene at any time by typing in the chat — absence of intervention is consent to the conversation.

**Silence is a valid reply.** Attend never escalates a message you chose to ignore. Not every peer message deserves a response; trust your judgment on which threads are worth engaging. Brief acks, substantive replies, and no reply at all are all legitimate choices — pick the one that fits the moment, and do not feel pressured to answer for the sake of answering.

Always wrap the message in double quotes to prevent shell metacharacter expansion (`?`, `*`, `!`). Keep messages under ~400 characters — peer notifications are one-per-line and longer payloads get truncated in-flight.

**CLI is the whole interface.** Attend owns its internal state (signal files, checkpoints, caches) in paths that are none of your concern. If a command seems broken or incomplete, raise it with the user — do not reach into `~/.cache/attend/`, `~/.config/attend/`, or any other attend-owned directory to work around it. Those paths are implementation details and can change at any time. The CLI is the contract.

### Focus groups

Named groups that agents focus on for shared signal routing. Groups are dynamic — join and leave as needed.

```bash
attend focus list                    # show groups you're focused on
attend focus on deploy               # focus on the "deploy" group
attend focus on infra --pin          # focus + pin (persists when empty)
attend focus off deploy              # release focus on a group
attend focus clear                   # release all groups (project only)
attend focus all                     # list all active groups with members
attend focus dissolve deploy         # remove a group entirely
```

### Scenes

Named presets that reconfigure focus group membership.

```bash
attend scene private                 # leave all groups (project only)
attend scene open                    # join the shared "open" group
attend scenes                        # list available scenes
```

### Discovery and status

```bash
attend peers                         # list active sessions with focus groups
attend status                        # instances, signals, and focus state
```

### Stopping

Use TaskStop with the Monitor's task ID. Attend exits cleanly on signal.

## Arguments

- `/attend` — start the sensor loop via Monitor (default)
- `/attend status` — run `attend status` via Bash

## Not for

- One-off status snapshots — just run `attend status`, `git status`, or `gh` checks directly; this starts a *persistent* sensor loop.
- External, task-specific watching (a PR's CI, your GitHub inbox) — that's the **gh-monitor** skill. Attend is ambient local-world awareness, not endpoint polling.
