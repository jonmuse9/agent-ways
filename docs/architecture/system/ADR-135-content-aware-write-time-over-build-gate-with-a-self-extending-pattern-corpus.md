# ADR-135: Content-aware write-time over-build gate with a self-extending pattern corpus

## Context

A write-time check now exists: `softwaredev/code/code.check.md` fires at `PreToolUse(Edit|Write)` on source files and surfaces a short anchor plus verification questions — does this need to exist, is this the codepath that actually runs, is this the minimal change. It ships with no engine change because it needs none: the `ways scan file` path matches a check to a file by its `files:` regex and never inspects what is about to be written. That is its ceiling. A question can ask "did you reach for the stdlib first?"; it cannot *see* the hand-rolled LRU cache, the reinvented email-regex validator, or the new dependency in the diff and name them.

Naming them requires the candidate content, which today never reaches the matcher. `check-file-pre.sh` forwards `tool_input.file_path` only, and `ways scan file` accepts `--path`, `--session`, `--project` — no content channel. Adding one is a genuine new capability, not a new file.

Three forces make it worth building, and one makes it dangerous:

1. **The friction is empirically at write-time.** An external, model-graded usage report (2026-05 to 2026-06, 92 sessions) shows the dominant friction buckets are Buggy Code (40), Wrong Approach (37), and Excessive Changes (7) — every one of them landing at the moment code is written, the exact moment this gate would fire.
2. **The minimalism content is well-understood.** The "ponytail" plugin's ladder (YAGNI → stdlib → native → installed dep → one line) and its review tags (`stdlib:`, `native:`, `yagni:`, `shrink:`) are a serviceable taxonomy for what over-build *looks like* in concrete code.
3. **The matcher already learns elsewhere.** ADR-134 established empirical tuning from fire and near-miss telemetry — but at the threshold and cadence level. Pattern *recognition* is the next level up and has no mechanism.

The danger is the obvious implementation. The ponytail model bakes one experienced developer's opinion into a fixed catalog. A fixed catalog nags at its edges: code that falls outside it is misjudged, and legitimately novel approaches read as "you're doing it wrong." A matcher that suppresses innovation because it has not seen it before is a failure we will not ship. The catalog cannot be the deliverable.

## Decision

Build the content channel, but make the thing it feeds a **learning matcher, not a static catalog**. The pattern corpus self-extends from comprehended encounters, bounded by the precision discipline already in force, so it grows understanding without growing dogma.

### 1. Content channel

`check-file-pre.sh` forwards `tool_input.content` (Write) / `tool_input.new_string` (Edit). `ways scan file` gains a `--content` input — or a sibling `ways scan write` subcommand — that pattern-scans the candidate code. Content is budget-reduced before scanning, consistent with ADR-130's uniform hook budget.

### 2. The gate, and what runs on the hot path

The gate emits ponytail-style `stdlib:` / `native:` findings plus a new-file line-count signal, and is silent otherwise. The hot path is cheap and does no inference:

- **Recognized pattern** → emit the finding (`stdlib: hand-rolled LRU — functools.lru_cache covers it`).
- **Unrecognized code** → **silence**, plus an *encounter* entry to the `events.jsonl` near-miss stream (ADR-134). Silence is the correct output, not a fallback.

There is no inline comprehension on the hot path. "Spend cycles to understand it" never means deep-analyze every keystroke — that would destroy the ambient, near-zero-cost value the firing engine exists to provide.

### 3. The loop — corpus growth happens out of band, and runs both ways

Comprehension and recording happen in a deliberate authoring/tuning pass modeled on `ways tune`, consuming the encounter telemetry the hot path emitted:

1. Read the encounter stream — the unrecognized writes the gate stayed silent on.
2. Comprehend the genuinely ambiguous cases (the cost is paid here, off the hot path, on a bounded sample).
3. **Record a finding — or, usually, do not.** A finding is either a new **match** (a real, generalizable reinvention) or an **exemption** (a legitimate or novel shape that must never be flagged). Most encounters are neither and stay silent and unrecorded.
4. **Prune** patterns whose telemetry shows them over-firing.

The loop is **bidirectional by design**. A loop that only adds matches becomes ponytail-by-accretion — a catalog that has "seen everything" and therefore nags at everything. That is the named anti-pattern. Recognition is provisional and revisable; a pattern earns its place from observed behavior and loses it the same way.

### 4. Precision discipline (inherited, not invented)

The gate inherits ADR-134's precision-first, zero-false-positive **hard constraint**. The corpus gets less ignorant over time *only through comprehension*, never through speculative up-front enumeration. Comprehensiveness is explicitly a non-goal: a small, high-confidence corpus that is silent on the unfamiliar beats a large one that is confidently wrong. The bootstrap seed is deliberately tiny — on the order of three or four patterns (hand-rolled LRU/TTL cache, email-regex validation, manual retry around an idempotent call, new-file line count) — and the seed is a starting point for the loop, not a specification of coverage.

This makes ADR-135 the first *content-level* and *pattern-level* application of ADR-134's machinery: 134 tunes thresholds and cadence from telemetry; 135 tunes recognition itself from the same substrate.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The write-time over-build signal becomes concrete: it names the specific reinvention in the candidate code, not just a generic "did you consider…". This targets the usage report's measured #1 friction at the point it occurs.
- The corpus is anti-fragile to novelty. The encounter ponytail would misjudge is exactly the encounter that, once comprehended, teaches the system — or is recorded as a permanent exemption. Unfamiliarity routes to silence-then-maybe-learn, never to a false flag.
- ADR-134's near-miss substrate gets its first concrete consumer beyond threshold tuning, validating that design end to end.

### Negative

- A new input channel widens the hot-path surface: content must be forwarded, budget-reduced, and scanned within the PreToolUse latency envelope. Pattern scanning must stay cheap (literal/regex shape matching, no inference).
- The loop requires human/agent attention on a cadence. Without the out-of-band pass, the corpus ossifies at its seed — functional, but not the learning system this ADR justifies.
- `events.jsonl` gains an encounter stream on top of 134's near-miss volume; the encounter margin needs a cap and the log needs rotation (134's concern, compounded).

### Neutral

- Tier 1 (`code.check.md`) is unaffected and remains valuable on its own; this ADR is strictly additive. If 135 is never implemented, Tier 1 still ships the questions.
- The ponytail review *tags* survive (`stdlib:`/`native:`); the ponytail *philosophy* (fixed, comprehensive, opinionated) is explicitly rejected. Only the finding shape is borrowed.
- Pattern entries become ordinary versioned artifacts — reviewable, revertible git diffs — like the frontmatter 134's `--apply` rewrites.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Static curated catalog (the ponytail model).** Rejected as the deliverable: it nags at its edges and cannot grow from experience. Its taxonomy is borrowed; its fixedness is the thing this ADR exists to avoid.
- **Model-graded per-write judgment (an LLM decides "is this over-built?" on every Write).** Highest fidelity, rejected for the hot path for the same reason ADR-134 rejected model-graded relevance: it adds inference cost to a system whose value is being cheap and ambient. It is admissible only in the out-of-band comprehension step, on a bounded sample.
- **PostToolUse lint instead of PreToolUse gate** (the shape the usage report literally suggested: `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)` running a formatter/type-checker). Complementary, not a substitute — it catches mechanical defects *after* the code lands, whereas over-build is a *before-you-write* decision. Worth adopting separately; it does not address this signal.
- **Append-only learning loop.** Rejected: monotonic growth reconstitutes the ponytail dogma by accretion. Pruning and exemptions are load-bearing, not optional.
