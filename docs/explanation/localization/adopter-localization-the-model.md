# Adopter localization — the model

This is the **explanation** companion to [[ADR-139]] (the decision to shelve
maintainer-maintained i18n and make localization adopter-run) and the design note
*Adopter localization lifecycle and tuning* (the mechanics). The ADR argues *why*;
these pages show *how the system behaves* for a real adopter — from a fresh install,
through switching languages, to the steady state.

If you read nothing else, read this page, then [[01.011.E]] (the language switch). The
numbered scenarios are independent — pick the one that matches your situation.

## The one distinction everything hangs on

agent-ways runs in one of two **modes**, and a single flag decides which.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q{ways.json<br/>output_language} -->|"en / auto (default)"| EN[ENGLISH MODE<br/>embedding match · 384-dim English model only · corpus tuning always on · no locale tuning]
    Q -->|"a non-English code (es, zh, ...)"| LOC[LOCALIZED MODE<br/>adds a 2nd embedding lane · 768-dim multilingual model × English-root-anchored multi corpus · root-anchored locale tuning]
```

- **English mode** is the default and the 99% case. The English corpus is still built
  and **tuned** — a new way, or a way whose `description`/`vocabulary` materially
  changes, recomputes its embedding and re-verifies its match and sibling
  discrimination (the semantic-intent decision belongs to the English root either way).
  What is **dormant** is the *locale* layer: nothing extra downloads, the heavier
  multilingual model is never loaded at match time, and there is no locale-alias tuning.
- **Localized mode** is what an adopter opts into. It is **explicit work**, performed
  once by the `ways-localize` skill, that flips the flag and builds the localized layer
  on top of the unchanged English root.

## Two flags, one bridge

Localization touches **two** different configs, and conflating them is the most common
confusion:

| Flag | Lives in | Means | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `language` | Claude Code `settings.json` | CC's **response** language | the operator (or ways-localize, as a courtesy) | the detection nudge (trigger) |
| `output_language` | agent-ways `ways.json` | ways **intl mode** | **`ways-localize`** | corpus build · matcher · tuning |

The **nudge bridges them**: when CC is set to Spanish but ways is still in English mode,
ways is under-serving the operator — and says so. Setting CC to Spanish must never, by
itself, trigger a 127 MB model download and a translate-everything pass; localization is
deliberate, consented work. The flag ways acts on is its own.

## The English root never moves

Whatever the mode, **English is the source of truth.** A localization is a *derivation*
validated against the English root, never a co-equal sibling — that is what keeps a
multilingual install from becoming a free-for-all with no fixed meaning. The mechanics
(root-anchored fidelity, the `output_language` gate, the match-compute saving) are in
[[01.013.E]] and the design note.

## The scenarios

| # | Scenario | The thing it shows |
|---|----------|--------------------|
| [[01.010.E]] | The English-native install | The default path — nothing to flag, nothing to do |
| [[01.011.E]] | The language switch | CC in Spanish → nudge → consented ways-localize → satisfied |
| [[01.012.E]] | Steady-state authoring | English root + one localization, maintained together |
| [[01.013.E]] | The mode gate | The mechanism: one flag, two modes, root-anchored tuning |
