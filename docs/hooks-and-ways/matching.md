# Matching Modes

How ways decide when to fire.

## Overview

Each way declares a matching strategy in its YAML frontmatter. The strategy determines what input is tested and how similarity is measured.

| Mode | Speed | Precision | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Regex** | Fast | Exact | Known keywords, command names, file patterns |
| **Semantic (embedding)** | Fast | Fuzzy | Broad concepts that users describe many ways |
| **State** | Fast | Conditional | Session conditions, not content matching |

Matching is **additive**: a way can have both pattern and semantic triggers. Either channel firing activates the way.

## Regex Matching

The default and most common mode. Three fields can be tested independently:

- `pattern:` - tested against the user's prompt text
- `commands:` - tested against bash commands (PreToolUse:Bash)
- `files:` - tested against file paths (PreToolUse:Edit|Write)

A way can declare any combination. Each field is a standard regex evaluated case-insensitively against its input.

### Why regex is the default

Most ways have clear trigger words. "commit", "refactor", "ssh" - these don't need fuzzy matching. Regex is fast, predictable, and easy to debug. When a way misfires, you can read the pattern and understand why.

### Pattern design considerations

Patterns need to balance sensitivity and specificity:
- Too broad: `error` fires on "no errors found"
- Too narrow: `error_handling` misses "exception handling"
- Right: `error.?handl|exception|try.?catch` catches the concept without false positives

Word boundaries (`\b`) help with short words that appear inside other words. The `commits` way uses `\bcommit\b` to avoid matching "committee" or "commitment".

## Semantic Matching

For concepts that users express in varied language. "Make this faster", "optimize the query", "it's too slow" all mean the same thing but share few words.

### How it works

A way with `description:` and `vocabulary:` frontmatter fields is automatically eligible for semantic matching. The `description` provides natural language context; the `vocabulary` provides domain-specific keywords. These are combined into a canonical alias per way and scored against the user's prompt using sentence-embedding cosine similarity (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for English, a multilingual variant routes locale stubs).

```yaml
description: debugging code issues, troubleshooting errors, investigating broken behavior
vocabulary: debug breakpoint stacktrace investigate troubleshoot regression bisect crash error
embed_threshold: 0.35
```

### Engine and setup

Semantic matching uses the embedding engine built into the `ways` binary (invoking `way-embed` internally against the corpus). The embedding model is a hard dependency — `make setup` fetches the binary and GGUF model.

If the embedding model is unavailable, semantic matching is silently skipped and pattern matching still works. See ADR-125 for the rationale behind the embedding-only design.

### Vocabulary design

Good vocabulary terms are domain-specific words that **users would say** when asking about the topic:

- **Include**: Terms users type in prompts — `bcrypt`, `xss`, `breakpoint`, `monolith`
- **Skip**: Generic terms that don't discriminate — `code`, `use`, `make`, `change`
- **Keep unused terms**: Vocabulary terms that don't appear in the way body are often intentional — they catch user prompts, not body text

Use `/ways-tests suggest <way>` to find gaps and `/ways-tests score-all "prompt"` to check for cross-way false positives.

### Sparsity over coverage

The goal of vocabulary design isn't to maximize each way's match rate — it's to maximize the semantic distance *between* ways. Each way should occupy a distinct region of the scoring space with minimal overlap. When a prompt fires exactly one way with a clear margin above others, the system is working well. When multiple ways fire on the same prompt, their vocabularies overlap and need sharpening.

This means expanding vocabulary can be counterproductive. Adding generic terms like `error` to the debugging way might catch more debugging prompts, but it also creates overlap with the errors way. Narrow, specific vocabulary creates sparsity — clean separation between ways — which is more valuable than broad recall on any single way.

### Which ways use semantic matching

Ways covering broad concepts where keyword matching would be either too narrow or too noisy:
- `testing` (2.0) — unit tests, TDD, mocking, coverage
- `api` (2.0) — REST APIs, endpoints, HTTP, versioning
- `debugging` (2.0) — debugging, troubleshooting, investigation
- `security` (2.0) — authentication, secrets, vulnerabilities
- `design` (2.0) — architecture, patterns, schema, modeling
- `config` (2.0) — environment variables, dotenv, configuration
- `adr-context` (2.0) — planning, approach decisions, context
- `knowledge/optimization` (2.0) — vocabulary tuning, way health analysis

All use threshold 2.0. The test harness maintains 0 false positives as a hard constraint.

## What This Actually Is

The vocabulary tuning workflow — choosing terms, measuring precision, eliminating false positives, running test fixtures — has a name. Several names, in fact, depending on which decade of research you're reading.

### The lineage

The matching system is a **text retrieval** system. The user's prompt is the query; the ways are the document collection; the embedding scorer ranks documents by relevance. This is the core problem of information retrieval, studied continuously since the 1950s.

| What we do | Established term | Field |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Choosing which terms to include/exclude per way | Feature selection / controlled vocabulary design | ML / library science |
| Tuning vocabularies so ways occupy distinct scoring regions | Discriminative feature engineering | ML |
| Removing terms like "risk" or "standard" after false positive detection | Precision optimization with hard constraint | IR evaluation |
| The 0 FP constraint with tolerable FN | High-precision classifier tuning | Classification theory |
| TP/FP/TN/FN tracking per scorer | Confusion matrix evaluation | Statistics (1940s+) |
| Co-activation fixtures with array expected values | Multi-label classification evaluation | ML |
| The test fixtures file with known-good judgments | Test collection / qrels | IR (Cranfield, 1960s) |

The test harness is essentially the **Cranfield evaluation paradigm**: a fixed test collection (`test-fixtures.jsonl`) + relevance judgments (expected values) + evaluation metrics (TP/FP/TN/FN). Cyril Cleverdon developed this at Cranfield University in the early 1960s. TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) has been running standardized evaluations on the same model since 1992. Our harness is a miniature TREC track.

Earlier versions of this system used Okapi BM25 (Robertson and Sparck Jones, 1976; refined at City University London's Okapi system through the 1990s) as the primary scorer. With the multilingual and semantic-coverage requirements in ADR-108 and ADR-125, the system moved to sentence-embedding cosine similarity as the sole retrieval tier. The IR lineage below still frames the tuning workflow, but the numerator changed from IDF-weighted term overlap to learned embedding similarity.

### Why this matters

The broader Claude Code ecosystem has developed its own vocabulary for agent steering: [Ralph Wiggum loops](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum), CLAUDE.md "constitutions," PROMPT.md steering files, AGENTS.md orchestration, "vibe coding." These are practical techniques — legitimate and useful — but the informal naming can obscure what's actually happening underneath.

What's happening underneath is information retrieval. The vocabulary tuning loop is **relevance engineering**: the iterative process of adjusting document representations to improve retrieval quality against a test collection with known-good judgments. The matching system is a **ranked retrieval** system with a precision-first objective. The sparsity principle is a restatement of **discriminative power** — descriptions that occupy distinct regions of embedding space produce clean matches, and descriptions that drift into neighbors produce confusion.

This isn't to diminish the newer work. Ralph Wiggum loops are a genuine contribution to autonomous agent workflows. CLAUDE.md files are effective cognitive scaffolds (see [rationale.md](rationale.md) for the situated cognition framing). But the matching and evaluation layer of this system draws from a 60-year research tradition, and knowing that tradition helps when you're stuck:

- If ways are cross-firing, you have a **discrimination** problem — read about IDF weighting and feature selection
- If a way isn't catching enough prompts, you have a **recall** problem — but expanding vocabulary trades recall for precision, so measure both
- If you're unsure whether your test fixtures are good enough, look at TREC's methodology for building test collections
- If the manual tuning feels unsustainable, the next step is **Learning to Rank** (LambdaMART et al.) — but at 20 ways and 70 test cases, hand-tuning is arguably more appropriate than ML

### Scale-appropriate methods

At our scale — ~20 ways, ~70 test fixtures — the manual approach isn't a compromise. It's the right tool. Learning to Rank, dense retrieval, and neural re-ranking shine at thousands of queries against millions of documents. We'd overfit immediately. What we built is closer to a hand-crafted decision tree, which is exactly what works when the domain is small, well-understood, and the humans have strong intuition about the categories.

The field term for where we sit: **manual relevance engineering** with **Cranfield-style evaluation**. If it was good enough for the researchers who built the foundations of web search, it's good enough for 20 ways.

## State Triggers

Unlike the other modes, state triggers don't match against content. They evaluate session conditions.

### context-threshold

Monitors transcript size as a proxy for context window usage. The calculation:
- Claude's context window: ~155K tokens
- Estimated density: ~4 characters per token
- Total capacity: ~620K characters
- Threshold at 75%: fires when transcript exceeds ~465K characters

The transcript size is measured since the last compaction (identified by `"type":"summary"` markers in the transcript JSONL). A cache avoids rescanning the full transcript on every prompt.

Unlike other ways, context-threshold triggers **repeat on every prompt** until the condition is resolved (task list created). This is deliberate: it's an enforcement mechanism, not educational guidance.

### file-exists

Checks for a glob pattern relative to the project directory. Fires once (standard marker) if any matching file exists. Useful for detecting project state - e.g., whether tracking files exist.

### session-start

Always evaluates true. Uses the standard marker, so it fires exactly once on the first UserPromptSubmit after session start. Useful for one-time session initialization that doesn't belong in SessionStart hooks.
