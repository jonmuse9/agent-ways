# Focus groups — dynamic agent grouping

Focus groups are attend's mechanism for **named signal scopes** that agents can join and leave dynamically. They solve the problem of "how do three agents talking about a deploy keep their signals scoped to each other without broadcasting to everyone else working on unrelated things."

This page covers the group model, how membership works, the on-disk layout, and how groups interact with the action potential engagement model. The authoritative source is **ADR-118**.

## The problem

Attend's earliest design had two signal scopes: **project** (your own cwd, encoded as a directory name) and **broadcast** (everyone). This was sufficient for two-agent coordination — "agent A replies to agent B in A's project dir, B reads it via its scan of own-project" — but it fell over at three or more agents working on related-but-not-identical work.

Concrete failure: agents on `api`, `infra`, and `docs` all working on a deploy together. If `api` sends a broadcast, it reaches `api`, `infra`, `docs`, and also every unrelated agent on the user's machine. If `api` sends to `infra` via `--to /home/aaron/.../infra`, that's directed and `docs` misses it. No way to say "reach the three agents working on this deploy, nobody else."

The original workaround was static paths: add `--focus` flags pointing at specific directories. But paths are implementation details — agents kept misrouting because they reasoned about filesystem layout instead of about group intent. There was no way to dynamically add or remove agents from a scope without the sender knowing everyone's cwd.

## The decision

Focus groups are **named signal namespaces**. An agent joins a group by name (`attend focus on deploy`); attend creates an `@deploy` signal directory and records the session as a member. Other agents join the same group by name, and they all read each other's signals via the shared `@deploy` dir. Leaving (`attend focus off deploy`) removes the agent from the membership and — if the group is unpinned and empty — removes the group entirely.

Groups compose naturally with the other two scopes:

| Scope | Routing target | Reached by |
|---|---|---|
| Project | `-encoded-cwd/` | anyone in the same cwd |
| Focus group | `@<name>/` | anyone who joined the named group |
| Broadcast | `_broadcast/` | everyone with attend running |

A single `attend send` can fan out to multiple scopes via flags; the default (ADR-119) is broadcast.

## CLI surface

```bash
# Join and leave
attend focus on deploy         # join the 'deploy' group, creating it if needed
attend focus on infra --pin    # join and mark the group as persistent when empty
attend focus off deploy        # leave the group; removes it if empty and unpinned
attend focus clear             # leave all joined groups (project scope only)

# Inspection
attend focus list              # show groups this session is focused on
attend focus all               # show all active groups with membership

# Management
attend focus pin <name>        # mark an existing group as persistent when empty
attend focus unpin <name>      # unmark; group gets cleaned up if empty
attend focus dissolve <name>   # remove the group entirely (ejects all members)
```

**Pinning** is for groups that should outlive any individual session's membership. An unpinned group is removed the moment its last member leaves; a pinned group persists even when empty so that new agents joining later can find it. Useful for long-lived coordination channels.

**Dissolving** is the hard-delete for groups. All members are notified (via a final broadcast from the dissolver), the `@<name>/` directory is removed, and the state entry is cleared.

## On-disk layout

Groups live under the signals base (`~/.cache/attend/signals/`) alongside the other scope directories:

```
~/.cache/attend/signals/
├── _broadcast/
├── _groups.yaml            ← membership state
├── @deploy/                ← focus group directory
│   ├── claude-abc123-1743280000.signal
│   └── claude-def456-1743280042.signal
├── @infra/
│   └── ...
└── -home-aaron-Projects-foo/
    └── ...
```

**Naming rules:**

- Group names start with `@` on disk; the `@` is prepended automatically by attend (the user types `attend focus on deploy`, attend creates `@deploy/`)
- Names cannot start with `_` or `@` (to avoid collision with reserved prefixes)
- Names cannot contain `/` or whitespace
- `broadcast` is reserved as a group name (would shadow `_broadcast`)

**State file: `_groups.yaml`.** Membership is tracked in a YAML file at the root of the signals base. Each entry records the group's pin state and the session IDs currently in it:

```yaml
deploy:
  pinned: false
  members:
    - abc123-...-session
    - def456-...-session
infra:
  pinned: true
  members:
    - abc123-...-session
```

Writes are atomic (write-then-rename pattern, fixed in issue #16). Concurrent `attend focus` commands from multiple sessions don't corrupt the file.

## The session-ID contract

Each attend instance knows its own session ID (`own_session_id()` reads from `~/.claude/sessions/*.json`). When joining a group, attend writes that session ID into the `members:` list of the `_groups.yaml` entry. When leaving, it removes its session ID. Stale entries for exited sessions are cleaned up opportunistically by `cleanup_stale()` — though the session-alive check is currently a stub that always returns true, so in practice dead sessions can linger in the membership list until the group is dissolved or manually cleaned.

This means group membership is **self-reported**. An agent adds itself to a group; no central authority verifies. The model assumes cooperative agents — which is the design assumption across all of attend, not specific to groups.

## How the peer sensor scans focus groups

`sensor-peers` scans three kinds of directories on every poll: own project scope, `_broadcast`, and every focus group the session has joined. As of the awareness-stabilization bundle (issue #15), the list of focus-group directories to scan is refreshed on every poll via a closure provider. Before this fix, attend captured the group list once at startup and never updated it; mid-session `attend focus on <name>` had no effect until the sensor loop restarted. Now the provider re-reads `_groups.yaml` on every scan, so joins and leaves take effect immediately.

The provider mechanism is simple: when `sensor-peers` is registered during startup, it receives a closure that clones the `Groups` handle. On each scan, it calls the closure, which returns the current list of joined group directories. The closure closes over an owned clone of `Groups` so it doesn't hold a borrow into the main loop state.

## Interaction with action potential (ADR-119)

Focus groups and engagement compose cleanly. Groups scope **which signals reach the agent**; engagement governs **how the agent responds once they arrive**. They operate at different layers:

- `attend focus on deploy` — agent now receives `@deploy` signals as well as project + broadcast
- New signals accumulate normally against the (possibly refractory-elevated) threshold
- If the agent just finished a burst of `@deploy` conversation, refractory is elevated, so only high-magnitude follow-ups break through
- The agent naturally disengages from fading deploy chatter while still picking up urgent signals

The per-peer engagement boost (see [`engagement.md`](engagement.md)) also applies across focus group boundaries. A peer you've been actively chatting with in `@deploy` gets their messages boosted globally, not just within that group. This is usually the right shape — "I've been talking to this agent a lot" is a conversation-level state, not a group-level state.

## The routing simplification from ADR-119

ADR-119 collapsed attend's peer-messaging routing down to a single default: **broadcast**. Before ADR-119, an agent had to reason about where to send messages — "should this go to a focus group? to a specific cwd? to broadcast?" — and routinely got it wrong. After ADR-119, the agent sends to broadcast and lets the engagement model sort out who pays attention.

Focus groups still exist and are still useful, but their role has shifted. They're not the primary routing mechanism anymore; the action potential's per-peer boost handles most "which agents should engage with this" decisions automatically. Groups are now better understood as **explicit scoping for cases where the engagement model isn't enough**:

- Multi-project coordination where you want signals visible to three specific agents and invisible to a fourth
- Long-lived coordination channels that should persist across session restarts (via `--pin`)
- Cases where you want to guarantee delivery regardless of engagement state

For ad-hoc conversations, broadcast + engagement boost is sufficient and simpler. For structured scopes, use groups.

## The TUI sidebar

The `attend chat` TUI (ADR-120, documented in [`tui.md`](tui.md)) puts focus groups in the left sidebar as a clickable filter. Each joined group is listed with an unread indicator; clicking filters the message stream to only that group. The sidebar is how a human gets a visual handle on the otherwise-invisible scope topology.

Importantly, clicking a group in the sidebar is a TUI-local filter — it doesn't change the session's actual group membership. To join or leave a group you still run `attend focus on` / `off` from a terminal (or, in future, via a TUI command). This separation means "looking at a group" and "being in a group" are distinct actions.
