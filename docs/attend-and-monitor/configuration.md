# Configuration

Attend reads a two-layer YAML configuration following the same overlay pattern as ways (ADR-115). User-scope config applies to every attend invocation; project-scope config layers on top to add or override specific settings for work in that project.

This page is the reference for the full config surface: where files live, what every key does, and how the overlay works.

## File locations

```
~/.config/attend/config.yaml                    # user scope — always loaded
<cwd>/.claude/attend.yaml                       # project scope — layered on top
```

Both files are optional. Attend ships with sensible defaults in code, so running with no config at all works. User-scope is for your persistent defaults; project-scope is for per-repo overrides.

The user-scope path respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set; otherwise it falls back to `$HOME/.config/`.

## Bootstrapping

```bash
attend config init      # write a default config to ~/.config/attend/config.yaml
attend config show      # print the merged config attend is currently using
attend config path      # print the file paths attend loads from
attend config lint      # schema-driven validation of user + project config files
attend config lint --fix   # remove unknown/deprecated keys in place
attend config lint --check # non-zero exit on errors (CI mode)
```

`attend config lint` validates both the user-scope and project-scope
config files against the same section schemas the loader knows about,
reporting typos (`UNKNOWN: ...`), fields the schema accepts but are no
longer load-bearing (`DEPRECATED: ...`), and unknown top-level sections.
The runtime loader intentionally ignores unknown keys so a typo never
crashes attend at startup — `config lint` is where those typos surface.
`--fix` surgically removes the offending lines (no YAML round-trip, no
reformatting of surviving keys). Fields whose name starts with `x-` are
an intentional-foreign escape hatch and the linter leaves them alone.

`attend config init` creates the user-scope file with fully commented defaults — useful as a starting point to understand what's available.

## Section reference

### `governor`

Global rate limiting for disclosures. Even if every sensor is ready to fire, the governor caps how many actually reach the conversation.

- **`base_cooldown`** (seconds, default 15): minimum time between any two consecutive disclosures. A burst of sensors all ready at the same time will have their disclosures serialized with at least this gap.
- **`max_per_window`** (count, default 3): maximum disclosures allowed within the rolling `rate_window`. Additional ready sensors are held; their magnitudes stay in the accumulator.
- **`rate_window`** (seconds, default 120): length of the rolling window for `max_per_window`.

With defaults: at most 3 disclosures per 2 minutes, with at least 15 seconds between each.

### `engagement`

The action potential model parameters. Governs per-sensor refractory behavior. See [`engagement.md`](engagement.md) for the full model and the ADR-123 reframing; the short version is:

- **`burst_threshold`** (count, default 3): number of recent fires that count toward triggering refractory. After the threshold is hit, the sensor enters the elevated-threshold state.
- **`step_multiplier`** (float, default 1.25): contributes to the peak refractory multiplier as `peak_multiplier = 1.0 + step_multiplier`. At the default, the peak multiplier is 2.25 — the effective threshold just after a burst is 2.25× the base threshold.
- **`absolute_refractory`** (seconds, default 60): complete suppression after a burst. No events fire during this window regardless of magnitude. Directly mapped to `Curve::ActionPotential::absolute_refractory` in ticks (= seconds for attend).
- **`decay_per_minute`** (float, default 0.1): exponential decay rate for the relative-refractory multiplier. At load time attend converts this to `multiplier_half_life = ln(0.5) / ln(1 - decay_per_minute) × 60` seconds. At `0.1`, the half-life is ≈ 395 s (~6.6 min); at `0.0256` (typical tune output), ≈ 1611 s (~27 min).
- **`burst_window`** (seconds, default 900): **DEPRECATED**. Parsed for back-compat but no longer a runtime parameter. Under ADR-123 the burst window is implicit in the multiplier's half-life — a history entry counts toward burst detection while its exponential contribution is still above ~1% epsilon. `attend tune` still emits this field because tune's internal heuristic uses it to derive `decay_per_minute`, but the live engine ignores it. `attend config lint` flags this key as `DEPRECATED` and `attend config lint --fix` will remove it from your config in-place.
- **`peer_activity_window`** (seconds, default 900): sliding window used by `sensor-peers` for the per-peer engagement boost. This *is* still tick-windowed — sensor-peers implements its own count-in-window logic rather than going through the shared curve engine, because the per-peer boost is a different shape than per-sensor refractory.

**Yaml field stability.** The yaml keys are deliberately preserved from pre-ADR-123 attend configs, so existing tuned configs keep loading without changes. Internally the keys are translated to the `Curve::ActionPotential` parameters attend actually runs on. The doc-level mapping is:

| yaml key              | runtime parameter                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `burst_threshold`     | `burst_threshold`                                  |
| `step_multiplier`     | `peak_multiplier = 1.0 + step_multiplier`          |
| `absolute_refractory` | `absolute_refractory` (seconds)                    |
| `decay_per_minute`    | `multiplier_half_life = ln(0.5)/ln(1-rate) × 60`   |
| `burst_window`        | *no runtime effect* (implicit via half-life)       |

**Auto-tuning.** Run `attend tune` to derive these from real session history. See [`engagement.md`](engagement.md#tuning-with-attend-tune) for how tuning works and how the linear-derived `decay_per_minute` relates to the engine's exponential half-life.

### `signals`

Presentation-layer aging for peer signals. Consumed by `sensor-peers` to decide whether an about-to-be-emitted observation is loud enough to surface. See [`salience.md`](salience.md) for the full design and ADR-121 / ADR-123 for the decision trail.

- **`half_life_seconds`** (u64, default 1800): exponential decay half-life. A signal's salience halves every `half_life_seconds` seconds of quiet since its arrival (or its last `record_fire` reset). 30 minutes is a conservative first value; subject to `attend tune` once survey coverage exists.
- **`presentation_floor`** (f64, default 0.3): below-floor signals are suppressed from the peer observation stream, without being deleted from disk. The 30-day retention sweep under `cleanup` is independent and unaffected.

The gate runs inside `sensor-peers::read_signals`, keyed by signal id (= filename stem — the same shape `re:<id>` references in ADR-120 threaded replies). A threaded reply automatically resets the parent signal's salience to 1.0 via `record_fire` at the reply's arrival tick, so thread-alive parents stay presentable for new observers joining the same shared signal dir.

`attend config lint` validates both keys; unknown sub-keys surface as warnings and can be removed with `--fix`.

### `cleanup`

Background signal-file cleanup. Prevents the signals base from accumulating indefinitely. Scoped strictly to `~/.cache/attend/signals/`; never touches ways data or anything else.

- **`enabled`** (bool, default true): master switch. If false, auto-cleanup is skipped and you must run `attend cleanup` manually to reclaim space.
- **`interval`** (seconds, default 600): how often the auto-sweep runs inside `attend run`. At this interval the loop scans the signals base and removes stale files.
- **`retention`** (seconds, default 2592000 = 30 days): age cutoff. Signal files older than this are removed.

The sweep also removes empty encoded-cwd project subdirectories left as shells after their signals are cleaned up. Reserved names (`_broadcast`, `@groups`, anything starting with `_` or `@`) are never removed.

`attend cleanup` can be run manually with overrides:

```bash
attend cleanup                        # use configured retention
attend cleanup --older-than 5m        # custom age cutoff
attend cleanup --dry-run              # list what would be removed
attend cleanup --all                  # nuke everything (no age check)
```

### `sensors`

Per-sensor configuration. Each built-in sensor can have its intervals, threshold, decay, and permissions overridden. User-authored sensors (script or crate) are declared in the same block with a `+` prefix.

**Existing built-in override:**

```yaml
sensors:
  git:
    interval: 60         # poll less often in this project
    threshold: 3.0       # raise the bar
```

**Disable a built-in:**

```yaml
sensors:
  -processes:            # the '-' prefix disables
```

**Add a new script sensor:**

```yaml
sensors:
  +github-project:
    script: $XDG_DATA_HOME/attend/sensors/github-project.sh
    interval: 300
    min_interval: 60
    threshold: 2.5
    decay_threshold: 3
    requires:
      - Bash(gh:*)
```

The `+` prefix declares a new sensor beyond the built-ins. Script paths are deliberately unconstrained — they can be:

- **User-global**, under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/attend/sensors/` (the convention this config documents by default). Survives across projects; lives in your own trusted script dir.
- **Project-scoped**, at `.claude/sensors/name.sh` in a specific repo. Only loads when attend runs from that project.
- **Absolute paths** to anywhere on disk — your personal tools repo, a team-shared scripts dir, `~/bin`, wherever you keep trusted executables.

Attend only cares that the path resolves and that the script respects the subprocess contract. The `$HOME`, `~`, and `$XDG_*` prefixes are expanded by the config parser, so `$XDG_DATA_HOME/...` in config becomes an absolute path at load time. This keeps configs portable across machines.

**The shipped example.** Attend ships one external sensor at `tools/attend/examples/xdg-downloads.sh` in the agent-ways repo as a reference implementation. The default user-scope config declares it as `+xdg-downloads:` with `enabled: false`. To actually run it you copy the script to a trusted location you control (the comment in the default config walks through `$XDG_DATA_HOME/attend/sensors/` as the XDG-convention choice), review it, and flip `enabled: true`. The "copy to a trusted path, review, then enable" workflow is intentional — external sensors run arbitrary shell under your user, and you should always audit a sensor's code before letting it run.

### Per-sensor keys

All sensors (built-in or script) accept:

- **`interval`** (seconds): base polling interval when quiet
- **`min_interval`** (seconds): fastest polling interval during active change
- **`threshold`** (float): emission threshold — accumulator must exceed this
- **`decay_threshold`** (count): number of quiet polls before interval decays back to base
- **`enabled`** (bool): set false to disable without removing the entry
- **`script`** (path, script sensors only): path to the executable
- **`requires`** (list): permission strings audited against `settings.json` (ADR-116)

Some sensors accept additional sensor-specific keys:

- **`processes.watch`** (list): overrides the default build-tool watch list. Only processes on this list get exit-code enrichment (success/failure magnitudes, marker correlation); everything else produces a plain `X exited`. Explicit-replace — passing `watch:` drops the defaults. See [`sensors.md`](sensors.md#watched-processes) for the default list and format examples.

## Overlay semantics

The overlay layers project-scope on top of user-scope. For each setting:

- **Scalar values** (numbers, strings, bools): project-scope replaces user-scope entirely
- **Sensor blocks**: merge on a per-key basis — a project can override just one sensor's interval without touching the others
- **Sensor additions** (`+name:`): union — the project can add script sensors the user-scope doesn't know about
- **Sensor disables** (`-name:`): marks the built-in disabled for this project only

Example. User-scope:

```yaml
sensors:
  git:
    interval: 30
    threshold: 2.0
```

Project-scope at `<repo>/.claude/attend.yaml`:

```yaml
sensors:
  git:
    interval: 60         # slow down git polling in this repo only
  -processes:            # don't run the process sensor here
  +build-watcher:
    script: .claude/sensors/build-watcher.sh
    interval: 20
```

Merged result in that project:

- `git`: interval 60 (from project), threshold 2.0 (inherited from user)
- `processes`: disabled
- `context`, `peers`: unchanged defaults
- `build-watcher`: active per project-scope declaration

## Permissions (ADR-116)

The `requires:` list on each sensor block declares the harness permissions that sensor needs. Running `attend permissions audit` walks your config and checks each declared requirement against `settings.json`:

```bash
$ attend permissions audit
Attend Permissions Audit
────────────────────────
  context        Read               ✓ granted
  git            Bash(git:*)        ✓ granted
  peers          Read               ✓ granted
  processes      Bash(ps:*)         ✓ granted
  +build-watcher Bash(cargo:*)      ✗ MISSING
```

Use this to confirm your config will actually work before launching attend — a sensor that requires a permission you haven't granted will silently emit nothing.

## Parser notes

Attend's YAML parser is deliberately minimal — it's a hand-written subset that handles the specific shape described above, with no `serde` dependency. It supports:

- Two-level section headers (`governor:`, `engagement:`, `signals:`, `cleanup:`, `sensors:`)
- Four-space indent for sensor properties
- Inline arrays (`requires: [Bash(gh:*), Read]`, `watch: [cargo, mix]`)
- Block-form lists on a new line (`requires:` followed by indented `- item` lines) for `requires:` and `watch:`
- Comments (`#`) and blank lines (they don't terminate a block-form list)
- `+name:` and `-name:` sensor prefixes

It does **not** support:

- Anchors and references (`&`, `*`)
- Multi-document files (`---`)
- Block scalars (`|`, `>`)
- Nested dicts beyond the documented depth

If you need something the parser doesn't handle, either restructure or file an issue. The parser will grow as needed, not speculatively.
