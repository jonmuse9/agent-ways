## What this note is

This note describes how `attend` should teach Claude how to *use* it — and, more importantly, how it should *re-teach* Claude over the lifetime of a session as the relevant instructions drift out of effective context.

It is the same problem ADR-104 solved for ways: instructional context that mattered at session start is not reliably present three reflection windows later. Ways answered with token-gated re-disclosure. Attend has the same shape of problem at a different surface — the *interactive messaging* surface — and the answer is structurally the same. Reusing the model preserves substrate separation (the cheap binary tracks token distance; the expensive substrate just reads what the cheap one decided to surface) and reinforces a single mental model for "Claude is being reheated on something."

## The problem

`attend` exposes interactive surfaces Claude must know how to use: `attend send`, `--to`, `--focus`, `--broadcast`, focus groups, mark-read semantics, when to ignore noise versus when to respond. Today, none of this is taught at runtime. Claude either learned it from `SKILL.md` at session start (and may have forgotten by turn 80) or never saw it (the skill loaded a sensor pipeline but not the reply protocol).

The cost of this gap is asymmetric. When a peer message arrives via Monitor, Claude reads the notification but may not remember *that it can reply, or how*. The notification tells Claude *something happened*; it does not tell Claude *what affordances exist to act on it*. The user pays an inference turn for Claude to either improvise, ask, or — most commonly — silently fail to engage.

The fix is to attach the affordance description to the moment Claude needs it: when a message arrives. And to attach it again, later, when enough of Claude's working window has scrolled past that the previous teaching is no longer load-bearing.

## The reheat principle, applied

Three properties carry over from ADR-104 verbatim:

1. **Re-disclosure threshold is token distance, not turn count.** The model from `ways-cli/src/session.rs` (`REDISCLOSE_PCT = 25`) is the threshold. One dial governs both ways' and attend's reheats; attend reads its current token position via subprocess call to `ways context --json` the same way `sensor-context` already does.
2. **Markers are cheap and non-load-bearing.** A `HashMap<Component, u64>` in the disclosure sensor's own struct. No disk, no session signal tree — clean-restart semantics by construction.
3. **The cheap substrate decides, the expensive substrate only reads.** Token tracking, threshold math, and emission all happen in the sensor-tick binary. Inference only sees the result.

**The disclosure lives inside a new sensor — not a special pipeline stage.** A `DisclosureSensor` implementing the existing `Sensor` trait from `sensor-trait`, just like `sensor-git` and `sensor-context`. Its signal is unusual (token distance since last disclosure for each registered component) but its shape is ordinary: poll returns observations, accumulator aggregates, governor gates, batch emits. This framing is load-bearing — it means no new architectural layer, no cross-sensor coupling, no pre-emit hook, no framework change. It also means batching with a peer-message arrival is **emergent**: when the disclosure sensor and peer sensor both cross their thresholds in the same governor window, they naturally co-emit in one Monitor notification. When the timing doesn't align, the disclosure fires on its own tick, alone.

## The DisclosureSensor

A new `sensor-disclosure` workspace crate, sibling to `sensor-git`, `sensor-peers`, `sensor-context`, and `sensor-processes`. Its `DisclosureSensor` implements the `Sensor` trait from `sensor-trait`. Nothing about the attend tick loop, emit pipeline, governor, or engagement state changes — the sensor plugs into the existing slot machinery exactly like every other sensor.

**State.** `HashMap<Component, u64>` on the sensor struct. Component ID → the `tokens_used` value at which this component last emitted. No disk, no `state.rs`, no session signal tree. Clean-restart semantics follow automatically: a new attend process starts with an empty map and re-teaches every component on its first opportunity.

**Poll.** On each tick the sensor is scheduled, it shells out once to `ways context --json` and reads the `tokens_used` field. For each registered component it walks the ledger:

- **No marker present** (first encounter after `attend run` start) → emit the component's disclosure text at full magnitude, stamp the baseline.
- **Marker present, distance ≥ 25% of the current model's context window** → emit the disclosure text at full magnitude, stamp the new baseline.
- **Otherwise** → no observation for this component.

Magnitude is fixed per observation (matching `sensor-context`'s discrete-threshold pattern), so the accumulator crosses the emission threshold immediately when a component qualifies. "Urgency slowly building up" is the conceptual progress toward the threshold; the mechanical fire is a single discrete step once it crosses.

**Interval.** Base `60s`, min `20s`, decay threshold `3` — roughly the same cadence as `sensor-context`, because the subprocess call is the same operation and the observable state changes at the same pace. Adaptive ramp-up isn't load-bearing here (token position only moves forward, never backward) but the existing knobs apply uniformly.

**Why the sensor framing is the right one.** Three properties fall out for free:

1. **First-run disclosure is automatic.** The first poll after `attend run` start finds every component with a missing marker and fires them all. No separate startup-banner injection, no special-case code in `main.rs`.
2. **Batching with peer messages is emergent.** When the disclosure sensor and `sensor-peers` both mark themselves `ready_to_disclose()` within the same governor window, the main loop's batch assembly puts them in the same `emit::emit_batch` call and Monitor groups them in its 200ms window. When timing doesn't align, the disclosure fires standalone at its own tick. Either outcome is fine — the teaching reaches Claude.
3. **The disclosure governor already applies.** No new rate-limiting knob needed. If the global disclosure budget is tight, the disclosure sensor waits its turn like everything else.

**Attend process session id.** The attend process resolves its session id via `own_session_id()` at `tools/attend/src/main.rs:1381` (process ancestry, no env var), but `DisclosureSensor` has no use for it — nothing is keyed by session id because nothing is written anywhere. The sensor is scoped to the *attend process*, which is strictly narrower than the session itself.

## Visual identity

The disclosure sensor emits through the standard `emit::emit_batch` path, so the wrapping header is `[attend sensor=disclosure priority=high] <text>` — attend's canonical sensor format, not ways' re-disclosure header pattern. An earlier draft of this note committed to "the same visual identity as ways re-disclosures," but sensor-native framing makes that commitment costly (it would require special-casing emit formatting for one sensor, against the grain of how every other attend sensor presents itself).

The decision is therefore: **uniform with attend sensors, not uniform with ways re-disclosures.** The `sensor=disclosure` name is still self-identifying — Claude can learn a single rule ("a `sensor=disclosure` emit is attend teaching me an affordance") without collapsing it into the ways reheat model. Consistency across attend sensors beats visual rhyme with ways re-disclosures when the cost of the rhyme is an emit-pipeline carve-out.

This becomes a reviewable decision when the design note is promoted to an ADR. If experience shows Claude benefits from the visual rhyme, the sensor can gain a custom emit header as a follow-up.

## Component registry

Even though `messaging` is the only component for now, the implementation is a registry from day one — an enum variant per component, each carrying a static component ID and the bundled markdown content as associated data. The reasoning:

- The next component is not hypothetical. `focus` (how Claude joins/leaves attention groups), `scenes` (how Claude switches between defined sensor pipelines), and `peers-introspection` (how attend models the broader session graph) are all plausible next entries.
- The cost of the registry today is an enum and a short iterator. The cost of refactoring after the second component is added is greater than that.
- Per-component state lives in the same `HashMap<Component, u64>` ledger inside the sensor. Adding a component is: add an enum variant, add a markdown file to `sensor-disclosure/src/disclosures/`, include it via `include_str!`.

The earlier qualifying-event-predicate concept is gone — in the sensor framing, every component follows the same trigger (first-encounter OR distance ≥ threshold), so no per-component predicate is needed. Components that want different semantics in the future can opt out of the shared poll and run their own logic inside the same sensor.

## Source of the instructional text

Each component's block is **bundled into the `sensor-disclosure` crate** via `include_str!("disclosures/{component}.md")`. Same posture as way bodies authored alongside their logic: it ships with the code that uses it, it cannot go missing at runtime, it is versioned in git alongside the sensor that depends on it. The alternative — reading the markdown from a path under `~/.claude/skills/attend/disclosures/` — was considered and rejected because it adds a missing-file failure mode without any compensating benefit (the skill directory is not edited at runtime by users, and rebuild is cheap).

The content of the messaging block is the *hard part of this work*. It must teach Claude how to use the messaging surface in a way that is worth its tokens. Concretely it should cover:

- That replies are sent with `attend send <text>` and that `--to`, `--focus`, and `--broadcast` exist.
- The semantics of focus groups and when to use them versus `--to`.
- When silence is the right answer (acknowledged-but-silent, per the cognitive-loop note).
- When to mark a message read versus letting it expire naturally.
- What *not* to do — most importantly, never to invoke `attend run` from Bash; it belongs to Monitor.

The block should be terse. It is paying its own token cost every time it fires; verbose teaching is self-defeating. Aim for a structure closer to ways body text than to SKILL.md prose: assertion-density first, examples only where the assertion is ambiguous without them.

## Non-goals

To be explicit about what this note does *not* propose:

- **No multi-component disclosure batching today.** Only `messaging` exists at first. The registry exists so the second component is cheap to add, not so multiple components can fire on a single event. A single disclosure per emit is the contract until experience demands otherwise.
- **No turn-based or wall-clock thresholds.** The substrate is token distance, identical to ways. Wall-clock and turn count are not the right unit because the cost being managed (Claude forgetting an affordance) is a function of context drift, not seconds or turns.
- **No global rate limiting layered on top of the existing disclosure governor.** The governor from the cognitive-loop note already enforces emit cadence on the underlying sensor events; attaching a disclosure to a passing event does not increase event count, only event width. No new governor knob is required.
- **No persistent storage of disclosure markers, anywhere.** The ledger is in-process memory and dies with the attend process. Forgetting on restart is a feature, not a bug — a new attend process is an opportunity to re-orient Claude, and the bundled markdown is the source of truth that travels with the binary. The `state.rs` persistence model (used for context-percentage tracking and git state) is deliberately not extended to hold disclosure markers, because the "stale file causes havoc" failure mode cannot be defended against cheaply.
- **No replacement for SKILL.md.** SKILL.md remains the authoritative reference Claude reads at skill load. The disclosure block is a runtime reheat of the parts of that reference Claude needs *during interactive use*, not a substitute for the full document.

## Implementation work order

Work proceeds on the existing `feat/attend-messaging-reheat` branch as:

1. **Create the `sensor-disclosure` crate.** Workspace member alongside `sensor-git` / `sensor-peers` / etc. Implements `Sensor` from `sensor-trait`. Contains the `Component` enum, the `HashMap<Component, u64>` ledger, the `ways context --json` subprocess call, and per-component bundled markdown under `src/disclosures/`.
2. **Author `sensor-disclosure/src/disclosures/messaging.md`.** This is the load-bearing content step; treat it with the same care a ways body deserves.
3. **Register the new sensor in `attend`.** Add to the workspace default feature set and slot it into the sensor registration in `tools/attend/src/main.rs` alongside the other sensors.
4. **Promote this design note to an ADR draft** once the working sketch validates the model, with the ADR cross-citing this note rather than re-deriving its argument.
