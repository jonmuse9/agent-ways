# Goals

`/goal` is a Claude Code built-in: it sets a completion condition and keeps the
session working turn-over-turn until a separate evaluator judges the condition
met. It's the autonomy primitive — it removes per-turn approvals. This way is the
*who/what/when/why*; the **goal-author** skill is the *how* (composing a
well-bounded condition).

## When to set a goal (vs. just act)

Set a goal when the work is **multi-turn, has a checkable end-state, and you'd
otherwise be re-prompting Claude to "keep going"** — a test suite to get green, a
consistency pass across many files, a migration. Don't set one for a single-step
task, or for open-ended exploration where the direction isn't settled yet — there,
ordinary turns and signposts serve better.

## What changes in goal mode

- **Per-turn approvals are gone.** Claude continues on its own until the condition
  holds; the `◎` indicator shows the regime is active. Setting a goal is consent
  to that — the operator should know they've entered it.
- **The evaluator judges surfaced text, not the world.** It can't run commands
  itself, so a condition must be met by *shown evidence* (an exit code, a clean
  status), not by assertion. Author for evidence, not claims.
- **There is no model-side abort.** Only the operator (`/goal clear`), the met
  condition, a timeout, or session end stops it. Claude can always *decline* an
  action and surface a concern — the loop blocks stopping, it never forces an
  action — but it can't end the loop itself. So the bounds live in the condition.

## Author the condition deliberately

Because the condition is the whole contract once per-turn approval is gone, frame
it with care: one measurable end-state, the evidence that proves it, a turn/time
bound, scope limits, and a door clause for any irreversible action (stop before
it, surface). The **goal-author** skill walks this collaboratively.
