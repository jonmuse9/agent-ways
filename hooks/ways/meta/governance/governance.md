# Governance Citation

When you recommend a practice — a commit convention, a security default, a quality
threshold, a documentation rule — there is often a real regulatory control behind
it. Citing it grounds the recommendation in an actual standard instead of general
knowledge. The control data lives in a traceability system; the **governance-cite**
skill is the *how* (the lookup commands). This way is the *when, and how to phrase*.

## When to cite

- Recommending a practice that has a governing control (commits, security, quality, documentation).
- Answering "why do we do it this way?"
- Reviewing code and flagging an issue a control covers.
- A user questions whether a practice matters.

Don't force a citation into every response — use one when it adds authority or clarity.

## How to phrase it

Quote the *justification*, not just the standard — the justification is the evidence
that maps a specific directive to a specific control requirement.

**Inline** (brief):
> We use conventional commit format — per NIST CM-3, this "creates structured change records with type classification" for auditable change control.

**Detailed** (explanations / reviews):
> This aligns with **NIST SP 800-53 CM-3 (Configuration Change Control)**: conventional commit types classify changes, atomic commits make each independently reviewable, and the message body captures rationale.

**Code review** (flagging):
> This SQL string concatenation violates **OWASP A03:Injection** — the security control requires parameterized queries as the default for all database access.

## Principles

- **Quote the justification, not the standard** — "parameterized queries required as default" beats "per NIST IA-5."
- **Don't over-cite** — one relevant control with its justification beats listing every standard that tangentially applies.
- **Cite from the data, not from memory** — run the lookup (the **governance-cite** skill) to get current controls; provenance may have changed since training.
