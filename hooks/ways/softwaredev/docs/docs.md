# Documentation Way

We write documentation in markdown, use language-appropriate docstrings in code, and use Mermaid for diagrams. These aren't arbitrary choices — markdown renders everywhere, docstrings live with the code they describe, and Mermaid diagrams are version-controllable text that renders in GitHub, VS Code, and most documentation tooling.

## Principles

- **Progressive disclosure** — Overview → Details → Deep dives
- **Task-oriented** — Organize by what people want to do
- **Keep README current** — Outdated README = broken front door
- **Scale to complexity** — Simple project = simple README. Complex project = README + docs tree
