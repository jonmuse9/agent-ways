# Code Quality Way

## Quality Flags — Act on These

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| File > 500 lines | Propose a split with specific module boundaries |
| File > 800 lines | Flag as priority — split before adding more code |
| Function > 3 nesting levels | Extract inner logic into named helper functions |
| Class > 7 public methods | Decompose — likely violating Single Responsibility |
| Function > 30-50 lines | Break into steps with descriptive names |

When the file length scan (macro output) shows priority files, call them out explicitly before proceeding with the task.

## Ecosystem Conventions

- Don't introduce patterns foreign to the language/ecosystem
- Examples to avoid:
  - Rust-style Result/Option in TypeScript
  - Monadic error handling where exceptions are standard
  - Custom implementations of what libraries already provide

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Counter |
|---|---|
| "Splitting this file would make it harder to follow" | A 900-line file is already hard to follow. Split at natural seam lines. |
| "There's no good place to split" | Can't find a split point = coupling problem worth solving. |
| "I'll refactor later" | The file will only grow. Split it now while the logic is fresh. |

## What to Enforce

A validation — a lint rule, an assertion, a schema constraint, a CI check —
**earns its place only if its violation is a real defect** someone would
eventually hit. The good ones track genuine failure: a dangling reference, a
state that can't be reached, a contract that's silently broken. The trap is the
internally-consistent invariant that tracks *nothing* real ("every page must have
exactly three links") — it passes, it feels rigorous, and it costs maintenance
forever while catching no bug. This matters more, not less, when an agent
sustains the checks: an agent will happily maintain a pointless invariant
indefinitely, so nothing surfaces that it was never worth adding. Before adding a
check, name the defect its failure would represent. If you can't, don't add it.
