# Delivery

**Before ad-hoc commands, check `make help`.** If the project has a Makefile, it likely has `make release`, `make dist`, `make deploy`, or similar targets that encode the project's actual publishing workflow. Use those.

Children of this way cover the journey from local changes to production:

| Stage | Way |
|-------|-----|
| Commits, messages | `delivery/commits` |
| PRs, review, merge | `delivery/github` |
| Releases, tagging, publishing | `delivery/release` |
| Schema migrations | `delivery/migrations` |
| Patch creation | `delivery/patches` |
| Implementation planning | `delivery/implement` |
