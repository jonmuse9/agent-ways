# GitHub Way

## Pull Requests — Always

We use PRs for all changes, including solo projects. A PR without reviewers still has value — it's a decision record, a CI gate, and muscle memory for when the project grows. Working solo without PRs is like doing research without keeping notes.

- **Solo/pair**: Lightweight PRs — a title and a few bullets is enough
- **Team**: Full PR with context, reviewers, and linked issues
- **Team (3+ contributors)**: Consider enabling [Claude Code Review](https://claude.com/blog/code-review) — automated multi-agent PR analysis that catches bugs skimmed reviews miss. $15-25/review, Team/Enterprise plans, org spending caps available

## Code Review Before Merge

After creating a PR, offer to spawn a `code-reviewer` subagent to review it before merging. This is the default workflow — don't wait for the user to request it.

## Merge Strategy — Prefer Regular Merge

Default to a regular merge commit (`gh pr merge --merge`), not squash. When a branch has multiple meaningful commits — ADR, implementation, follow-up fixes, review responses — each carries its own narrative, and `git log` on main should preserve that story. Squashing flattens the history into one commit and loses the reasoning trail future readers would otherwise see.

Ask before merging; don't choose a strategy unilaterally. If the user says "merge it" without specifying, offer: "regular merge or squash?"

Squash is only the right call when the branch is single-purpose with commit noise you genuinely want to drop (typo fixes, WIP snapshots, lint autofix commits). If the commits each document a distinct step, keep them.

Never rebase-merge unless the user explicitly asks — it rewrites authorship and timestamps in ways that surprise collaborators.

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After merging a PR, always run the full cleanup: `git checkout main && git pull && git fetch --prune`, then `git branch -d <branch>`. Stale branches accumulate fast — clean up every time.

## When User Mentions GitHub

**Trigger words**: "issue", "PR", "pull request", "review", "comments", "checks"

**If ambiguous, clarify**:
- "Do you mean a GitHub issue, or a problem to investigate?"
- "Should I check GitHub PRs/issues, or look in the code?"

## Common Commands

```bash
# Finding issues
gh issue list --search "keyword"
gh issue list --label bug
gh issue view 123

# PR operations
gh pr view                    # Current branch PR
gh pr view 42                 # Specific PR
gh pr checks                  # CI/test status
gh pr view --comments         # Review comments

# Creating PRs
gh pr create --title "feat: Description" \
  --body "## Changes\n- Item 1\n- Item 2"

# ADR PRs
gh pr create --title "ADR-003: Decision Title" \
  --body "## Context\n\n## Decision\n\n## Consequences"
```

## What to Use
- **PRs**: Always — lightweight for solo, thorough for teams
- **Issues**: Optional, for requirements/discussions/bugs
- **Labels**: Basic set (bug, enhancement, documentation)

## Repo Health

The macro checks repository configuration (README, license, templates, branch protection, badges, etc.) and reports what's missing. If the report shows gaps:
- Offer to help configure items the user has rights to fix
- For items needing admin access, note them but don't push
- When badges are missing, suggest adding shields.io badges below the README title (license, stars, version)

## What to Avoid
- Complex project boards
- Elaborate milestone hierarchies
- Over-labeled issues
