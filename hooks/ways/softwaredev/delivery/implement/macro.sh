## Safe Parallelization

Enter plan mode and think through work collision **before** creating tasks. Defend each parallelization decision — if you can't articulate why two tasks won't collide, they're sequential.

### Collision Analysis

| Risk | Example | Verdict |
|------|---------|---------|
| Same file | Two tasks editing `config.yaml` | Sequential — never parallelize |
| Import chain | Task A edits module, Task B edits its caller | Sequential — interface changes cascade |
| Independent modules | New utility + new test fixtures | Safe to parallelize |
| Read-only research | Investigating patterns across codebase | Safe as subagent (no edits) |
| Independent test files | Tests for unrelated features | Safe to parallelize |

### Isolation Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | How |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Worktree** | Tasks editing different file sets with no shared imports | `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` |
| **Subagent** | Research, review, analysis — read-only work | `Agent(subagent_type: ...)` |
| **Sequential** | Tasks with file overlap or dependency chains | One after another in main context |

### Rules

- **When in doubt, go sequential.** Collision cost far exceeds waiting cost.
- **Never parallelize tasks that touch the same file.** Not even "different sections."
- **Worktree tasks must be self-contained.** They can't see main-tree edits until merged back.
- **Subagents for research are always safe.** Read-only work can always run in parallel.

### Execution Order

1. Start sequential tasks first (critical path)
2. Launch parallelizable tasks together when dependencies are met
3. Review worktree changes before integrating
4. Run tests after each integration point, not just at the end
