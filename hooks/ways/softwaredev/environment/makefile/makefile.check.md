## anchor
This project has a Makefile. Use `make <target>` instead of running raw commands.

## check
Before running this command directly:
- Does `make help` list a target that does the same thing?
- The Makefile wraps these commands with the project's conventions (flags, env, ordering)
- Running raw commands bypasses any project-specific setup the Makefile provides

Run `make help` if you haven't already, then use the appropriate target.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Counter |
|---|---|
| "I'll just run it directly this once" | The Makefile exists because direct commands have gotchas. Use it. |
| "The Makefile probably just calls the same thing" | It often adds flags, env vars, or ordering you'll miss. |
| "I need to pass custom args" | Many Makefile targets accept variables: `make test ARGS="--verbose"` |
