description: going over the stuff you have added to a machine over time and deciding what you no longer need — auditing a workstation for forgotten, unused, or leftover software you installed and stopped using, reviewing what accumulated, grouping it by subject, and trimming the cruft. The retrospective audit-and-cull side of installing software, distinct from project dependency management.

# Package History as a Behavioral Journal

The package manager's log is an *involuntary journal*. The user never sat down to write it, but every line is timestamped intent they couldn't fake in retrospect. When someone asks "what have I added that I don't need anymore?", don't just dump a package list — read the log as a time series. The shape is the answer.

## Three signatures

| Signature | What it looks like | What it means |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Burst** | Several related packages on the *same day* | One focused sitting with a goal (set up remote desktop, rice the desktop, tune the CPU). Burst density ≈ how deep the flow state was. |
| **Thread** | A theme recurring across months | Durable identity, not a whim. A persistent interest the log *proves*. Keep it. |
| **Orphan** | A cluster that appeared once and never recruited a neighbor or got revisited | Abandoned. **This is the strong cull signal — not age.** Old ≠ unused; a stable tool used daily can be a year untouched. A theme that *stopped recruiting* is done. |

The builder layer is the sharpest marker: packages the user *authored themselves* (their own AUR/local builds) mark a need no existing tool fit. They cluster around whatever the user was deep in at the time.

## What the log cannot see

- **Install ≠ use.** No telemetry on what actually runs. The log shows intent, not habit.
- **Survivorship.** `pacman -Qm` / `brew leaves` show only what *survived*. For the true series — including removals and upgrade churn — read the transaction log, not the current state.

## Extraction

| Manager | Deliberate adds | Dated history (incl. removals) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| pacman/yay | `pacman -Qm` (foreign), `pacman -Qet` (explicit leaves) | `/var/log/pacman.log` (`installed`/`removed`/`upgraded`, all timestamped) |
| apt | `apt-mark showmanual` | `/var/log/apt/history.log*` |
| dnf | `dnf history userinstalled` | `dnf history` |
| brew | `brew leaves` | `~/Library/Logs/Homebrew` / `brew info --json` install times |

Dated AUR list (pacman): `expac --timefmt='%Y-%m-%d' '%l\t%n' $(pacman -Qmq) | sort`

Focus pass 1 on **deliberate adds** (AUR/manual) — native repo leaves are mostly DE/base noise. Group by *subject*, then call out redundancy clusters *inside* each group (two remote-desktop stacks, three themes only one of which can be active, a build-tool cluster left over from one project). That's where the cull candidates hide.

## Render the timeline

Phases over time are sequential — show, don't narrate. Pipe a Mermaid `timeline` to `mmaid` for terminal art:

```bash
mmaid <<'EOF'
timeline
    title host — what the install log remembers
    2025-04 Bootstrap : shell, grub, mounts (provisioning, not exploring)
    2025-07 Infra sprint : whole remote-access stack in one sitting
    2026-05 Re-provision : browser+editor+toolchain in one burst
EOF
```

## Don't

- Flag "unneeded" by install date. Age is a weak signal; recruitment is the strong one.
- Persist a curated inventory before the cull — documenting cruft that's about to be culled wastes the write. Cull first, then offer to record the post-cull state.
- Remove without a reverse-dependency check (`pactree -r` / `pacman -Rsp` dry run). Let the user drive every "kill it".
