# Time Tracking & Billing

Log billable hours against clients and projects. Always confirm before logging.

## Logging Workflow

1. **Review what was worked on.** Check the session's activity:
   - Emails drafted or sent (which client/project?)
   - Meetings attended (from calendar)
   - Tasks completed or worked on
   - Other work discussed in conversation
2. **Match to clients and projects.** Map each work item to a client and optionally a project.
3. **Propose time entries.** Present a summary:

```
Suggested time entries for today:
  [Client A] / [Project] — 1.5h — "Description of work"
  [Client B] / [Project] — 2.0h — "Description of work"
  Personal / Admin — 0.5h — "Email triage, calendar management"
Log these? Adjust any?
```

4. **Log on approval only.** Never auto-log.

## Weekly Time Review

When doing a weekly review, include:
- Total hours by client and project
- Comparison to typical week (if historical data available)
- Hours logged vs. calendar time (utilization)
- Uninvoiced time that may need billing

## Invoicing

Invoice creation requires explicit confirmation. Always present:
- Billing period
- Total hours
- Line items by project
- Calculated amount

before creating any invoice.
