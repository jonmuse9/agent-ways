# Cross-Service Intelligence

Pull data across email, calendar, file storage, chat, meeting recordings, and tasks to build a complete picture.

## Meeting Prep

When preparing for a meeting:

1. **Calendar event details** — attendees, description, links, from all accounts.
2. **Recent email threads** with attendees — what's been discussed recently?
3. **Chat history** — check the meeting's group chat for pre-meeting context and shared links.
4. **Previous occurrence** — if recurring, pull the last meeting's recap, action items, and transcript.
5. **Shared documents** — check file storage for recently shared or edited docs related to the topic.
6. **Open tasks** — surface commitments related to this meeting's attendees, client, or project.

Present as a concise prep brief: who's attending, what's been discussed, what's open, what to bring up.

## Weekly Review

Comprehensive end-of-week synthesis:

| Section | Sources |

Synthesize into a document if the user requests it.
