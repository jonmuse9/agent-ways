Event-driven cognitive steering for AI coding agents. Ways encode *how we do things* — prescriptive guidance triggered by context, not requested by intent — and inject them just-in-time before tools execute.

> **Current status:** Agent Ways ships with full support for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Support for additional CLI-based coding agents is in development.

```

**Ways** = policy and process encoded as contextual guidance. Triggered by keywords, commands, and file patterns — they fire once per session, before tools execute, and carry into subagents.

**Why this works:** System prompt adherence decays as a power law over conversation turns — instructions at position zero lose influence as context grows. Ways sidestep this by injecting small, relevant guidance near the attention cursor at the moment it matters, maintaining steady-state adherence instead of a damped sawtooth. It's [progressive disclosure](docs/hooks-and-ways/context-decay.md) applied to the model itself.

### Session replay with `ways rethink`

`ways rethink` replays a completed session's way-firing history as an interactive TUI animation. Each frame shows a way firing at a specific point in the conversation — you can see how guidance clusters near the active attention cursor and packs into the context window like a compression pattern.

<img src="docs/images/ways-rethink.gif" alt="ways rethink replaying a session — each frame shows a way firing, guidance clusters near the attention cursor and packs like a compression pattern as context fills" width="400" />

Ways fire via the **embedding engine** (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a ~21MB GGUF model), which achieves ~98% accuracy on the match fixture set. The embedding tier handles semantic similarity — "pin lockfile versions" matches the supply chain way even though those exact words don't appear in the way's vocabulary.

This repo ships with software development ways, but the mechanism is general-purpose. You could have ways for:
- Excel/Office productivity
- AWS operations
- Financial analysis
- Research workflows
- Anything with patterns your agent should know about

## Prerequisites

Runs on **Linux** and **macOS**. The core system is a Rust binary (`ways`) plus thin bash hook scripts:

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | The agent this configures | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| `ways` | Unified CLI — matching, scanning, linting, governance | Downloaded or built by `make setup` |
| `git` | Version control, update checking | Usually pre-installed |
| `jq` | JSON parsing (hook inputs, configs, API responses) | **Must install** |
| `python3` | Governance traceability tooling, chart-tool | Stdlib only — no pip packages |
| [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub API (update checks, repo macros) | Recommended, not required — degrades gracefully |

`make setup` acquires the `ways` binary automatically: pre-built download from GitHub Releases → build from source (requires `cargo`/Rust toolchain) → error with instructions. Standard utilities (`bash`, `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`, `timeout`, `tr`, `sort`, `wc`, `date`) are assumed present via coreutils.

**Semantic matching** uses the **embedding engine** (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via a separate `way-embed` binary, ~98% accuracy on the fixture set) as the sole retrieval tier. The embedding model is a hard dependency of `ways` and is fetched by `make setup`:

```bash
make setup   # download ways binary + embedding model (~21MB), generate corpus
```

See [Semantic Matching](docs/hooks-and-ways.md#semantic-matching) for the full setup and engine comparison.

**Platform install guides:**
[macOS (Homebrew)](docs/prerequisites-macos.md) · [Arch Linux](docs/prerequisites-arch.md) · [Debian / Ubuntu](docs/prerequisites-debian.md) · [Fedora / RHEL](docs/prerequisites-fedora.md)

> **macOS note:** `timeout` is a GNU coreutils command not present by default. Install `coreutils` via Homebrew — see the [macOS guide](docs/prerequisites-macos.md) for PATH setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone (fork first if you plan to customize)
git clone https://github.com/aaronsb/agent-ways ~/.claude

# Set up semantic matching engine (downloads ~21MB model)
cd ~/.claude && make setup

# Restart Claude Code — ways are now active
```

Or as a one-liner (clones to temp, verifies, then installs):

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronsb/agent-ways/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --bootstrap
```

The built-in ways cover software development, but the framework is domain-agnostic. Fork it, replace the ways, add your own domains.

> **Already have `~/.claude/`?** The installer detects existing files and won't clobber them. See the **[install guide](docs/install-guide.md)** for how to back up, merge, or start fresh. If you're sure: `scripts/install.sh --dangerously-clobber`.

> **Stop and read this** if you're letting an AI agent run the installer. You are about to let an agent modify `~/.claude/` — the directory that controls how Claude Code behaves. The agent is editing its own configuration. Review the repo first. You are responsible for the result.

## How It Works

`core.md` loads at session start with behavioral guidance, operational rules, and a dynamic ways index. Then, as you work:

1. **UserPromptSubmit** scans your message for keyword and semantic (embedding) matches
2. **PreToolUse** intercepts commands and file edits *before they execute*
3. **SubagentStart** injects relevant ways into subagents spawned via Task
4. Each way fires **once per session** — marker files prevent re-triggering

Matching has two channels: regex patterns for known keywords/commands/files, and [sentence-embedding](docs/architecture/system/ADR-108-embedding-based-way-matching-with-all-minilm-l6-v2.md) semantic scoring (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). See [matching.md](docs/hooks-and-ways/matching.md) for the full strategy.

`ways list` shows the live session state — which ways fired, when (epoch), how far back (distance), what triggered them, tree relationships, check decay curves, and a re-disclosure forecast showing when distant ways will re-fire as context fills:

<img src="docs/images/ways-list-session.png" alt="ways list showing live session state — epoch when each way fired, distance in context, colored pins for attention proximity, tree disclosure, and a forecast of when distant ways will re-fire" width="100%" />

For the complete system guide — trigger flow, state machines, the pipeline from principle to implementation — see **[docs/hooks-and-ways/README.md](docs/hooks-and-ways/README.md)**.

## Configuration

Ways config lives in `~/.claude/ways.json`:

```json
{
  "disabled": []
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `disabled` | Array of domain names to skip (e.g., `["itops", "softwaredev"]`) |

Disabled domains are completely ignored — no pattern matching, no output.

## Creating Ways

Each way is a `{wayname}.md` file with YAML frontmatter in `~/.claude/hooks/ways/{domain}/{wayname}/`:

```yaml
---
description: semantic text    # embedding semantic matching (preferred)
vocabulary: domain keywords   # space-separated terms augmenting the embedding
embed_threshold: 0.35         # cosine similarity threshold (optional per-way tuning)
pattern: commit|push          # regex on user prompts (supplementary)
commands: git\ commit         # regex on bash commands
files: \.env$                 # regex on file paths
macro: prepend                # dynamic context via macro.sh
scope: agent, subagent        # injection scope
---
```

Matching is **additive** — regex and semantic are OR'd. A way with both can fire from either channel.

**Project-local ways** live in `$PROJECT/.claude/ways/{domain}/{wayname}/{wayname}.md` and override global ways with the same path. Project macros are disabled by default — trust a project with `echo "/path/to/project" >> ~/.claude/trusted-project-macros`.

## Testing Ways

After creating or tuning a way, verify it matches what you expect — and doesn't match what it shouldn't.

```bash
# Score a way against sample prompts (inside Claude Code)
/ways-tests score security "how do i hash passwords with bcrypt"

# Rank all ways against a prompt
/ways-tests score-all "write some unit tests for this module"

# Validate frontmatter
ways lint --global

# Vocabulary gap analysis
ways suggest --file ~/.claude/hooks/ways/softwaredev/code/security/security.md

# Embedding similarity scores
way-embed match --corpus ~/.cache/claude-ways/user/ways-corpus.jsonl \
  --model ~/.cache/claude-ways/user/minilm-l6-v2.gguf \
  --query "pin lockfile versions"

# Sibling vocabulary overlap (Jaccard)
ways siblings softwaredev/code/supplychain/depscan/node

# Session simulation tests (Rust integration tests)
make test-sim

# Interactive: full hook pipeline with subagent injection
# Start a fresh session, then: read and run tests/way-activation-test.md
```

The embedding engine achieves 98.4% accuracy (63/64) with 0 false negatives on the fixture set.

Other test tools: `scripts/doc-graph.sh --stats` checks documentation link integrity; `ways governance lint` validates provenance metadata. Full test guide: [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## What's Included

This repo ships with **85+ ways** across six domains — covering commits, security, testing, debugging, dependencies, architecture, documentation, and more. The live index is generated at session start. **Replace these entirely** if your domain isn't software dev.

| Domain | Ways | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| `softwaredev` | 50 | Commits, security, testing, debugging, deps, supply chain, architecture, delivery |
| `meta` | 19 | Ways system itself — knowledge, authoring, optimization, introspection |
| `ea` | 10 | Executive assistant — email, calendar, scheduling |
| `itops` | 4 | Infrastructure operations |
| `research` | 1 | Research workflows |
| `writing` | 1 | Writing and documentation |

Also included:
- **[Agent teams](docs/hooks-and-ways/teams.md)** — three-scope model (agent/teammate/subagent) with scope-gated governance and team telemetry. When one agent becomes a team, every teammate gets the same handbook.
- **6 specialized subagents** for requirements, architecture, planning, review, workflow, and organization
- **[Usage stats](docs/hooks-and-ways/stats.md)** — way firing telemetry by scope, team, project, and trigger type
- **Update checking** — detects clones, forks, renamed copies; nudges you when behind upstream

## Why Ways? (Rules, Skills, and Ways)

Claude Code ships two official features for injecting guidance: **Rules** (`.claude/rules/*.md`) and **Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`). Ways solve problems that neither can.

### The progressive disclosure problem

Rules and ways both inject guidance conditionally — but their disclosure models are fundamentally different:

- **Rules** disclose based on **file paths** (`paths: src/api/**`). The project's directory tree *is* the disclosure taxonomy. This works when concerns map cleanly to directories, but most concerns don't — security, testing conventions, commit standards, and performance patterns cut across every directory.

- **Ways** disclose based on **actions and intent** — what you're doing (running `git commit`), what you're talking about ("optimize this query"), or what state the session is in (context 75% full). The disclosure schedule is decoupled from the file hierarchy entirely.

This matters because of how attention works in transformers. Rules loaded at file-read time are closer to the generation cursor than startup rules, but ways inject at the **tool-call boundary** — the closest possible point to where the model is actively generating. The [context decay model](docs/hooks-and-ways/context-decay.md) formalizes why this temporal coupling outperforms spatial coupling for maintaining adherence over long sessions.

### Three features, three jobs

| | **Rules** | **Skills** | **Ways** |
|--|-----------|------------|----------|
| **What** | Static instructions | Action templates | Event-driven guidance |
| **Job** | "Always do X" | "Here's how to do Y" | "Right now, remember Z" |
| **Trigger** | File access or startup | User intent (Claude decides) | Tool use, keywords, state conditions |
| **Conditional on** | File paths (directory tree) | Semantic similarity | Multi-channel: regex, embeddings, commands, files, state |
| **Cross-cutting concerns** | Needs duplicate `paths:` entries | N/A (intent-based) | Single way fires regardless of file location |
| **Dynamic content** | No | No | Yes (shell macros) |
| **Survives refactoring** | No (`src/` → `lib/` breaks paths) | Yes | Yes |
| **Non-file triggers** | No | No | Yes (`git commit`, context threshold, subagent spawn) |
| **Governance provenance** | No | No | Yes (NIST, OWASP, ISO, SOC 2 traceability) |
| **Org-level scope** | Yes (`/etc/claude-code/`) | No | No |
| **Zero-config simplicity** | Yes (drop a `.md` file) | Yes | No (requires hook infrastructure) |

**Rules** are best for static, always-on preferences ("use TypeScript strict mode", "tabs not spaces"). **Skills** are best for specific capabilities invoked by intent ("ship this PR", "rotate AWS keys"). **Ways** are best for context-sensitive guidance that fires on events, cuts across the file tree, and needs to stay fresh in long sessions.

They compose well: rules set baseline preferences, ways inject governance at tool boundaries, skills provide specific workflows. The [full comparison](docs/hooks-and-ways/README.md#ways-rules-and-skills) covers the architectural details.

> **Is this just RAG?** Ways and RAG solve the same fundamental problem — getting the right context into the window at the right time — but through different architectures. RAG retrieves by semantic similarity; Ways retrieve by event. RAG is stateless; Ways track session state. The [full comparison](docs/hooks-and-ways/ways-vs-rag.md) explores what's shared, what's different, and when each approach wins.

## Governance

Ways are compiled from policy. Every way can carry `provenance:` metadata linking it to policy documents and regulatory controls — the runtime strips it (zero tokens), but the [governance operator](governance/README.md) walks the chain:

```
Regulatory Framework → Policy Document → Way File → Agent Context
```

The [`governance/`](governance/) directory contains reporting tools and [policy source documents](governance/policies/) — coverage queries, control traces, traceability matrices. Designed to be separable. The built-in ways carry justifications across controls from NIST, OWASP, ISO, SOC 2, CIS, and IEEE.

Most users don't need governance. It's an additive layer that emerges when compliance asks *"can you prove your agents follow policy?"* See [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md) for the full reference.

## Philosophy

Policy-as-code for AI agents — lightweight, portable, deterministic.

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Dual-channel matching** | Regex for precision, embeddings for semantics — no cloud API needed |
| **Shell macros** | Dynamic context from any source (APIs, files, system state) |
| **Minimal dependencies** | `ways` binary + bash + jq — no runtime services, no cloud APIs |
| **Domain-agnostic** | Swap software dev ways for finance, ops, research, anything |
| **Fully hackable** | Plain text files, fork and customize in minutes |

## Updating

At session start, `check-config-updates.sh` compares your local copy against upstream (`aaronsb/agent-ways`). It runs silently unless you're behind — then it prints a notice with the exact commands to sync. Network calls are rate-limited to once per hour. After pulling, run `make setup` to update the semantic matching corpus.

| Scenario | How detected | Sync command |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Direct clone** | `origin` points to `aaronsb/agent-ways` | `cd ~/.claude && git pull` |
| **Fork** | GitHub API reports `parent` is `aaronsb/agent-ways` | `cd ~/.claude && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` |
| **Renamed clone** | `.claude-upstream` marker file exists | `cd ~/.claude && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` |
| **Plugin** | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set with `plugin.json` | `/plugin update disciplined-methodology` |

### Renamed clones (org-internal copies)

If your organization clones this repo under a different name without forking on GitHub, update notifications still work via the `.claude-upstream` marker file. It uses `git ls-remote` against the public upstream — no `gh` CLI required.

| Goal | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Opt out entirely** | Delete `.claude-upstream` and point `origin` to your internal repo. |
| **Track a different upstream** | Edit `.claude-upstream` to contain your internal canonical repo. |
| **Disable for all users** | Remove `check-config-updates.sh` from `hooks/` or delete the SessionStart hook entry in `settings.json`. |
