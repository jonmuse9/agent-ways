# Robust `make update` front-half: pull + prune, surviving the machine-local
# edge cases that make a bare `git pull --ff-only` abort.
#
# Two recurring causes:
#   1. settings.json — tracked (shared hooks/permissions) but machine-mutable
#      (plugin enable-state, notification prefs, language). Diverges per machine.
#   2. Stale tracked build artifacts (e.g. tools/way-embed/build/Makefile on a
#      checkout from before they were gitignored) — modified locally by a build.
#
# Strategy: autostash everything, fast-forward, prune merged branches, then
# restore. On a restore conflict we DO NOT clobber — we preserve the stash and
# tell the operator exactly how to resolve. Build artifacts are safe to discard
# (the rebuild step regenerates them); settings.json is not, so it's surfaced.
#
# `make update` runs `update-binaries` + `install` after this script returns.
