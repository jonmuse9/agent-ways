# xdg-downloads.sh — example attend external sensor
#
# Observes new files landing in the user's XDG Downloads directory and
# emits attend signals when something arrives. Demonstrates:
#
#   1. The external-sensor protocol: one line per event on stdout as
#      `magnitude|description`, silent exit on quiet, 10s timeout.
#   2. Reading XDG user-dirs to locate a well-known folder, with a
#      sensible fallback if xdg-user-dirs isn't installed.
#   3. Tracking state across polls via a marker file under XDG_STATE_HOME
#      so attend restarts don't flood with old files.
#   4. Designing a magnitude hierarchy: one file is notable, a batch
#      of files is a clear burst worth surfacing more loudly.
#
# This is a pedagogical example. It runs on any typical Linux distro
# with no dependencies beyond bash and coreutils. Disabled by default
# in the attend config — flip `enabled: true` in the sensor block to
# turn it on.
#
# Author's lever: magnitude. Everything else is attend's job.

# --- Resolve the Downloads directory via xdg-user-dirs -----------------

# xdg-user-dirs writes ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs with lines like:
#   XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Downloads"
# We parse it manually instead of sourcing to avoid executing
# arbitrary shell from a config file.

USER_DIRS="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/user-dirs.dirs"

# this as a quiet poll.

# --- State marker ------------------------------------------------------

# gives us files modified since then. We store it under XDG_STATE_HOME
# per the base directory spec.

# --- Detect new files --------------------------------------------------

# Top-level files only (no recursion into subdirectories). Keeps the
# scan fast and avoids walking large archives users have extracted.

# here. Do this whether or not there were new files — the marker is
# a rolling high-water mark.

# Quiet poll — return with no output. attend will see an empty
# Vec<(f64, String)> and treat it as "nothing changed this tick."

#   1 file    → 2.0 (notable — a single arrival is worth surfacing)
#   2-3 files → 2.5 (small batch — something's happening)
#   4+ files  → 3.0 (clear burst — breaks through into notifications)
#
# These land above the default emission threshold of 2.0 for script
# sensors, so a single file will fire on its own. If you want more
# aggregation, lower the magnitudes here and raise `threshold` in
# your attend config so multiple files accumulate before firing.
